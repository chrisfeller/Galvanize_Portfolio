# Galvanize Portfolio

Collection of case studies I completed while working through the [Galvanize Data Science Immersive Program](https://www.galvanize.com/denver-platte/data-science). Employed modern machine-learning techniques to produce efficient, action-oriented, and presentable solutions to industry relevant problems.  

[Churn Case Study](https://github.com/chrisfeller/Galvanize_Portfolio/tree/master/Churn_Case_Study)
Built Gradient Boosting model to predict churn for a ride-sharing company in San Francisco. Predicting the likelihood of churn based on user profiles in order to provide suggestions to improve user retention. 

[Regression Case Study](https://github.com/chrisfeller/Galvanize_Portfolio/tree/master/Regression_Case_Study)
Utilized ridge regression to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equipment at auction based on it's usage, equipment type, and configuration.

[Recommender Case Study](https://github.com/chrisfeller/Galvanize_Portfolio/tree/master/Recommender_Case_Study)
Built recommender system utilizing surpriselib to improve upon existing recommender for video-streaming service. 

[Fraud Detection Case Study](https://github.com/chrisfeller/Galvanize_Portfolio/tree/master/Fraud_Detection_Case_Study)
Created a web-based app, which pulls in streaming data from an e-commerce website. That data is then run through a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a certain posting is fraudulent. The resulting prediction is saved to a MongoDB and displayed on the web-app.
